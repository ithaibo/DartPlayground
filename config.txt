Japan’s bullying bosses
As Honda Soichiro built his company into a global car making giant, he developed a reputation as a talented engineer. He was also known to be an exacting boss, even a violent one." When he got mad, he started throwing whatever was in reach randomly at people, " one former executive later recalled. Such fiery tempers remain all too common among Japanese managers. A Japanese psychologist even coined a term to describe the particular abuse that the country’s supervisors pile upon some of their employees: pawahara, or power harassment.
Complaints of harassment in the workplace have been growing in recent years, hitting a record high of 82, 797 in 2018, up from 32, 242 a decade earlier. The trend worried the government enough to spur recent passage of anti-harassment legislation. As of June 1st, Japanese firms are required to have clear policies in place and to create internal systems for reporting and verifying claims of abuse.
At the extreme end, workplace bullying can still include physical violence of the sort displayed by Honda. More typically, it manifests itself in all manner of verbal, emotional and psychological abuse. Japan’s labor ministry defines six categories of power harassment: physical attacks, mental attacks, social isolation, excessive demands, demeaning demands and privacy infringements.
Although bad bosses are a universal phenomenon, Japanese workplaces can be particularly conducive to the worst sort of behavior. Hierarchies are rigid and deeply rooted. The inflexibility of Japan’s labor market compounds the problem." People can’t easily quit if they hate their boss and companies can’t easily fire bad bosses, " says Rochelle Kopp of Japan Intercultural Consulting.
